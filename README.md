This course explores the concepts and algorithms at the foundation of modern artificial intelligence, 
diving into the ideas that give rise to technologies like game-playing engines, handwriting recognition, and machine translation. 
Through hands-on projects, students gain exposure to the theory behind graph search algorithms, classification, optimization, 
reinforcement learning, and other topics in artificial intelligence and machine learning as they incorporate them into their own Python programs. 
By courseâ€™s end, students emerge with experience in libraries for machine learning as well as knowledge of artificial intelligence principles 
that enable them to design intelligent systems of their own.

Degrees:
    Determine how many degrees of separation/connection two people are with breath-first search.

Tic-tac-toe:
    Write an AI that can play tic-tac-toe, with minimax and alpha-beta pruning.

Knights: 
    Solve knowledge base logical puzzles, with defining base knowledge and current game knowledge.

Minesweeper:
    write a AI that can play minesweeper, make the best move from her knowledbe base and add to it. Mostly wins, guesses are unavoidable in some cases.

PageRank:
    Write an AI to rank web pages by importance, using Markov Chain.

Heredity:
    Write an AI to assess the likelihood that a person will have a particular genetic trait, using join probabilities and normalisation.

Crossword:
    Write an AI to generate crossword puzzles using arc consistency.

Shopping:
    Write an AI to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase.

Nim:
